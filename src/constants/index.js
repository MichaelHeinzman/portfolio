    description: `In collaboration with my team, we leveraged software engineering methodologies to model and document the system's 
          architecture and functionality. This included developing fully dressed use cases, domain diagrams, system sequence diagrams, 
          sequence diagrams, and class diagrams. These artifacts showcased our ability to analyze and represent complex systems effectively.

          To lay the foundation for implementation, we utilized our Java programming skills to create pseudocode for the application. 
          This demonstrated our proficiency in Java development, as well as our understanding of fundamental programming concepts and algorithms.`,
